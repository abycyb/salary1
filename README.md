# salary1

Input a valid excel file which has
no blank rows or unnecessary
white spaces after each string in a cell.

The program runs by finding exact string match
For e.g:
if i[0]==("HRA")    >>here the code is trying to find exact match for the given string ("HRA") by iterating through the cells of excel file.


So while inputing the excel file, one must keep in mind that the salary component names are an exact match(case sensitive).
